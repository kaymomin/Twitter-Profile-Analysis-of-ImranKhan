# Analyzing the Twitter Profile of Imran Khan - Prime Minister of Pakistan.


Before diving into details, here are the key parts of the projects:
- Create an account on Twitter
- Use Tweepy to scrap the Tweets
- Create a Panda DataFrame
- Sentiment analysis
- Word frequency analysis


## Step 1: Create an account on Twitter
In order to access Twitter Streaming API, we need to get 4 pieces of information from Twitter: API key, API secret, Access token and Access token secret. But for that we need to create a twitter account.
So create an account if you don't already have one.

## Step 2: Use Tweepy to scrap the Tweets

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

## Step 3: Getting Twitter API keys and connecting to Twitter Streaming API
-   Go to  [https://apps.twitter.com/](https://apps.twitter.com/)  and log in with your twitter credentials.
-   Click "Create New App"
-   Fill out the form, agree to the terms, and click "Create your Twitter application"
-   In the next page, click on "API keys" tab, and copy your "API key" and "API secret".
-   Scroll down and click "Create my access token", and copy your "Access token" and "Access token secret".

[Tweepy](https://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#introduction) is easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API. **(pip install tweepy)**
